# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

At Kleiner Perkins Fellows, we deeply value diversity, equity, and inclusion. We understand that a diverse talent pool is not just the right thing to do, but it also plays a pivotal role in achieving high performance. We strive to create an environment where everyone, from any background, can thrive and succeed.

Our Fellows program is specifically designed to encourage and empower the next generation of diverse talent. We strongly encourage underrepresented minorities to apply and contribute their unique perspectives and talents.

## Our 2022 Class

Our 2022 class exemplifies our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. It's made up of outstanding individuals from diverse backgrounds, fields of study, and life experiences.

## Our Commitment to Progress

While we're proud of the strides we've made, we acknowledge that we still have work to do. Transparency about our current state is a crucial step towards our goal of building an increasingly diverse and inclusive community.

We are actively working on further strategies and initiatives to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion within our Fellows program. We're committed to continuous learning, listening, and action as we strive to make our community more representative and inclusive.

We invite you to join us in this mission as we work towards a more equitable future in the tech industry.
