lucasrollo. Lucas. Rollo. Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner. Perkins. Fellow | Honors. CS @ Texas. A&M personal. ACoAABa--- United. States. Mountain. View, California. Mountain. View. California. Mountain. View, California, United. States. False. False. Computer. Software. NotiFire (TAMUhack. Winner) Inspiration: After the wildfires in. California and now the wildfires in. Australia, we were interested in how we could do our part to mitigate as much danger and get as many people and animals the help they need. What it does: NotiFire is a multi-platform app that uses crowdsourced data from users and. Twitter to display information about animals/people in need, help centers, and the active location of fires on the map. There is a mobile version where users can upload information about animals/people in trouble and view the map on the go. Additionally, there is a web version where users can, in more detail, view the map with all of its information. How we built it: We used. Python and the. FastAPI. Framework to develop a backend. API for both platforms. We then used. Flutter to create the mobile version of the app and. ReactJS to create the web version. Some of the technologies we utilized include the. Google. Maps. API, Breezometer. API, and. Google. Image. Recognition. API. Challenges we ran into: It was hard trying to create both mobile and web versions of the app. There was a learning curve to picking up the new. APIs and backend framework. We definitely spent most of our time on the frontend, trying to get the data to load on the map and read from our backend. API. Lucas. Rollo. Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner. Perkins. Fellow | Honors. CS @ Texas. A&M. CloseCash (HackRice. Winner) Inspiration: For a lot of us, ATMs seem to be far away when we need them the most. People who are serviced by local banks often can't find familiar. ATMs to withdraw from if they can find one at all. For the of us personally, we are tired of paying extra fees and borrowing money from friends. We'd like to get the cash we need when we need it. That's why we thought of creating a peer-to-peer. ATM system that matches receivers and tellers to each other based on location and price, all thanks to. Capital. One and. Google's. API. What it does: Allows users that need close cash to match with tellers that are ranked in a list based on location and amount of cash on hand. The application consists of a receiver and teller interface, your most recent transaction, and a ranked search for the closest teller. How we built it: The app was built using. Node.js/MongoDB in the backend and. ReactJS in the front end. We utilized. Capital. One's. API to create and use customer ids to make transactions in the application. Additionally, we used the. Google. Maps. API to find a users location for the searching and ranking algorithm. Lastly, we made heavy use of. Passport.js, Sessions, Cookies, and. Axios to secure user data and communicate between multiple servers. Challenges we ran into: Initially, we planned for too many features and we're heavily stressing over getting it all done. After innovating and figuring out what features really matter, we were able to spend more time on debugging big issues and developing a robust system. Some of the big technical problems we faced had to do with sending. Cookies and. Sessions from the back-end to the front-end, learning. ReactJS for an elegant. UI, and interacting with both the. APIs we used. What we learned: We learned a ton about. MERN stack development and working with a separate front-end and back-end server. Most of our project consisted of technologies we had never used before such as. ReactJS, Google. Maps. API, Capital. One. API, and other. JS packages. Lucas. Rollo. Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner.

Committee. Member; General. Council. Member. DevLink (HowdyHack. Winner) Inspiration: With a team of sophomores and a freshman, we have struggled with gaining "relevant experience" for internship opportunities. It's also very difficult to learn the numerous technologies it takes to build a successful application on top of school work and extra-curriculars. That's why we wanted to build a fast-paced and short-term developer matching app to allow students at. Texas. A&M to quickly start projects together based on their shared interests and skills. What it does: Matches student developers to each other and encourages collaboration on projects. This was specifically implemented by using a "discover" page where you can briefly read about fellow devs and decide if you'd like to work with them. If a match is found, a live chat will open so more details can be shared and a project can be done. The concept and. UI are very lean so students are encouraged to act fast and take their projects seriously. How we built it: We used. Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB for the backend and. HTML/Sass/EJS for the front-end. We also implemented libraries like. Passport and. Google. OAuth . for secure login. Additionally, we had a big focus on ease-of-use. UI so we heavily depended on. Socket.io and. EJS templates to create highly dynamic webpages. Lucas. Rollo. Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner. Perkins. Fellow | Honors. CS @ Texas. A&M. BestFit (Aggies. Invent. Winner) BestFit is a mobile and web app concept that allows users to accurately try on clothes for themselves and friends virtually. The app utilizes. Augmented. Reality (AR) to allow users to create an accurate model of themselves and then have the ability to search for and try on clothes for an elevated retail experience. Our concept won place at. Aggies. Invent in. December and has continued development since. We also be competed at the. Engineering. Project. Showcase in. April . Currently, the team consists of engineering students with a wide variety of skills and abilities. If you are interested in working with us, feel free to reach out to me. Lucas. Rollo.
