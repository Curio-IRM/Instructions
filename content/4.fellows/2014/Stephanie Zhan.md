Spanish. PROFESSIONAL_WORKING. Internet. Zynga. Zynga. Head of product for. Zynga. Poker, a leading social gaming franchise. In this capacity. I manage a team of product managers through all parts of operating an at-scale internet product - ideation, backlog prioritization, spec development, feature implementation, release management, tuning, data analysis, feature readouts, data-driven investigations, and feature iteration. I have been a people manager since . My experience has taught me to be as enthusiastic about the strategic pieces of product management as the weeds of execution in order to deliver excellent results. I believe in defining goals clearly up front and holding that goal as a north star through the development process. By partnering closely with stakeholders across levels and disciplines, I have developed crisp communication, thick skin, and a strong ability to recall facts. Above all, I strive to be resilient and empathetic as a colleague and a leader. Roles held: Director of. Product (-present) Lead. Product. Manager (-) Senior. Product. Manager (-) Product.
