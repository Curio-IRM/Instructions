pippajthomas. Pippa. Thomas. Product. Manager at. Instacart personal. United. States. Los. Angeles. Metropolitan. Area. Los. Angeles. Metropolitan. Area. False. False. Internet. Hilton's. Hospitality. Hackathon, Place for. Frictionless. Guest. Experience. Worked with a team of five other students (over the course of three days) to solve a problem in hospitality. We designed and developed a platform and intelligent algorithm to increase the efficiency of housekeepers. By factoring in room vacancy, guest location, check in/out status and other pre-existing. Hilton data, the algorithm can create and update a live list of rooms for housekeepers to visit, saving (on average) hours of transition time a month. Hilton. Hotels, Cornell eHub. Reality, Virtually, Hackathon with. MIT. Media. Lab. Developed rescuAR, an application for. HoloLens that aids search and rescue teams in recovering victims. It provides real time data on areas that have been searched, allowing rescuers to tag space with relevant information. The goal is to prevent duplication of effort and maximize number of lives saved. Check out my team's work on. Devpost: And our code on. GitHub: MIT. Media. Lab. Lockdown. Hackathon, University of. Buffalo, Place. Worked with team of three others to keep our servers, databases, and virtual machines running while constantly under attack by the "red team" during this hour hackathon. In addition, completed a series of inputs to locate various flags. CNY. Hackathon , Place. The. Girl. Scout. Gold. Award. As an -hour community service project to complete my work as a. Girl. Scout of years, I created a. Skin. Cancer. Awareness curriculum. It has been implemented at multiple schools across. Los. Angeles, CA and is available for download at. Girl. Scout's of. Greater. Los. Angeles. MLB. Advanced. Media. Challenge. In an effort to increase the personalization of the customer's experience at the ballpark, my team and. I created an additional facet to the already built "MLB. Ballpark" app. Using augmented reality we created the wireframe of an interface a user can interact with on top of a live camera feed (similar to. Pok√©mon. GO). This would include scanning the field and being able to tap on players and get instant information, or walking around the ballpark and seeing various virtual items pop up on the camera footage screen to then click for more information. And to keep user's retained during the off-season, allowing users to scan player's favorite restaurants or places to go, receive points and then a perk before the season begins. At the conclusion of the project we pitched our idea to. MLBAM's employees. Pippa. Thomas. Product. Manager at. Instacart. Instacart. San. Francisco, California, United. States. Instacart.
