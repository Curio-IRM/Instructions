Cooper de. Nicola. Stanford. Computer. Science. B.S., M.S. | Cyber. Security. CampusFeels. Mobile. App. Mobile phone application designed at. TreeHacks for use on college campuses. The application enabled students to anonymously share their current feelings with others on campus. Their feelings are geolocated onto a map alongside a timestamp. Then our. NLP sentiment analyzer would determine the feeling's sentiment to create a color-code for the geo-stamp. This creates a colored map of campus expressing the feelings of individual students. Due to the increasingly important issue of mental health on college campuses, this application is intended to allow students to share their feelings anonymously with others on campus, show students that they are not alone. The facade of the perfect. Stanford student (Stanford. Duck. Syndrome) means that real emotions and struggles are often suppressed. It is heartwarming to be able to connect with people on campus and see how they feel, in a familiar, yet anonymous way. Cooper de. Nicola. Stanford. Computer. Science. B.S., M.S. | Cyber. Security.
