Corporation. Reversible. Metal. Electrodeposition on. Pt-Functionalized. Transparent. Conducting. Electrodes for. High. Quality. Dynamic. Windows. Electrically controlled dynamic windows offer attractive opportunities to improve the energy efficiency and aesthetics of our buildings and modes of transportation. Electrochromic materials that readily change color as a function of voltage are ideal candidates for dynamic window applications. Unfortunately, these materials have yet to be widely commercialized due to complications and tradeoffs associated with color, switching speed, durability, and cost. In this work, we study the reversible metal electrodeposition of. Bi and. Cu on a. Pt-functionalized transparent conducting electrode for high-quality dynamic windows. We develop a stoichiometrically optimized electrolyte formula to construct electrochromic devices with bistable, reversibly tunable transmission at fast switching speeds. Our results show improved deposition uniformity and sheet resistance achieved with the. Pt-modified cathode, and our colorless electrolyte enables great optical performance. Altogether, our windows demonstrate uniform switching between a clear state, with over % transmission, and a color-neutral black state, with under % transmission. Additionally, our electrochromic devices can be cycled in less than one minute, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous metal-based dynamic window architectures. Maxmillian. Minichetti. Founder | Stanford ' Handwritten. Mathematics to. LaTeX. Code. In this study, we present a fully end-to-end, deep learning pipeline capable of generating the. LaTeX code associated with an input mathematical image. The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with integrated visual and semantic attention mechanisms. For model training, we leverage a rich dataset of over , LaTeX images linked to their ground truth markup. Metrics such as. Levenshtein distance and. BLEU score were used to assess performance and compare between models. We managed to achieve a. BLEU score of % and image edit accuracy of %. Our image-to-LaTeX system could benefit students, researchers, and professors alike by saving them valuable time spent transcribing work from paper to. PDF. Such a system might aid in the development of next-generation grading systems and artificially intelligent notetakers for students with documented disabilities. With sufficient data, our model could be applied more generally to convert images of other languages, such as handwritten python or. C++, into valid markup. Maxmillian. Minichetti.

David. L. Quantitative. Researcher at. Citadel. Securities. Prediction of. Cellular. Service. Quality. Used ordinary least squares, support vector regression, and random forest regression to predict the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of mobile devices. Achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of . dB on. RSSI test data ranging from to dB in magnitude. Current mobile devices can tell us when a cell signal or. WiFi connection is weak; however, they fail to provide useful information for obtaining a better signal. A compact machine learning model, capable of predicting. RSSI from real-time network conditions and location measurements, could provide mobile device users with a personal heuristic for locating areas of optimal cell service. This could also benefit cell service providers in determining a favorable deployment of cell towers over a region. As cell carrier companies work to improve their coverage by using insights obtained via this predictive algorithm, periodically retraining the model to reflect these targeted improvements results in a positive feedback loop to benefit mobile device users all over the world. Maxmillian. Minichetti. Founder | Stanford ' Tetris. AI. In this project, we take a reinforcement learning approach to play the game of. Tetris. By modeling the game states in terms of the board and current tetromino, we use. TD. Learning and genetic algorithms to determine an evaluation function for picking the best possible move at each step. We built six different agents to test combinations of depth-k search, feature selection, TD learning, and genetic algorithms. Our top-performing model was depth- search using the evaluation function found by genetic algorithm. This model was able to clear over , lines, beating out even the best human players. Maxmillian.
