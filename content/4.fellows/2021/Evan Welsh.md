University of. Michigan, my team built a service that allowed users to access the internet via text messages. This service relied directly on. Twilio to create a static phone number that users could send text messages to and receive text feedback from. We used the. Twilio webhooks to enable real-time text message transfer, from the. Twilio service to our. Azure backend. MHacks, Twilio. Best use of. IBM. Bluemix at. PennApps. XII (Haptic. Vision for the. Blind) PennApps during the fall of was the largest hackathon to date with over hackers from across the world. More than projects were submitted. My team developed an innovate new way of navigation for those affected by blindness. We used. IBM. Bluemix extensively to host a. Node.JS server that facilitated communication between our hardware while providing an interface for us to utilize. IBM. Watson to analyze images, identify faces and produce speech from text. IBM. Drone. Regulator. Awarded: -Breaker. Prize ("Most unique hack") Demo: At the spring. HackNY, my team built a web app to provide and enforce dynamic local airspace and. FAA regulatory information for hobby pilots while flying their drones. This includes altitude restrictions, prohibited airspaces, large events, potentially dangerous weather and numerous other possible flight inhibitors. The web app provided a real-time video stream and the ability to control your drone with a. PlayStation. DualShock controller and/or a keyboard. The drone runs a robotics framework, Cylon.js, which allows our web app to communicate to it over socket.io. The regulation data was scraped from. Airmap’s.

Node.JS (Bluemix server and. Pebble application) or. Python (Leap. Motion interface scripts). A much more technical write-up of the project is available in the. README at our. GitHub repository ( Colin. King ✌️ Smartify. Awarded: Place, Best. Use of. Twilio, Best. Hack with a .CO. Domain. At. MHacks. VI, a person hackathon hosted by the. University of. Michigan, my team built a system to allow people who do not have access to the internet (either because they own a feature phone, or internet is not available in their area) to still access internet-connected applications by leveraging the power of. SMS and the cloud. We used. Twilio to create an accessible phone number that users can text. A server running on. Microsoft. Azure is set up to listen to the webhooks associated with this phone number and will pull any new text messages from. Twilio. These texts are parsed and new application instances are started. A core framework is provided that will provide the parsed commands to an application which can do anything a normal internet-connected application would do, and will return the application's results to the user via text messages. On the developer end, we created a full featured web-based. IDE and app store that provide developers with an area to create applications on top of our core framework and immediately deploy them to.
