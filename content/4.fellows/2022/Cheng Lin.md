yash-moondhra. Yash. Moondhra. Building the # crypto tax platform | ex-CTO @ Duffl (YC ) personal - I'm from the suburbs of. South. Florida. I couldn't stand the humidity so. I went to college in. California (UCLA). When. I first came to campus, I found myself standing in front of. Jackie. Robinson's statue every day. I could not get over the idea that alumni like him had walked the same steps as me when they were my age. That made me realize that. I was in an environment where anything was possible, so. I dared to dream big. At that time, four years ago, I had to work at. Wendy's because. I was rejected by every tech company. I applied to. Since then, I‚Äôm fortunate to have been a leader of a fast-growing. YC startup, a. Fellow of the. Kleiner. Perkins venture capital firm, and a backend engineer at. Robinhood during its brightest days. These achievements are just the first few steps of the mountain. I want to climb. Why am. I doing this? Because the best experience of my life happened when. I was deeply inspired by an idea, and gave it my undivided focus for four years through disheartening failure and rejuvenating success. My career journey made me realize that. I wanted to pursue an entirely new approach to life ‚Äî one where. I would strive to be my best in everything important to me, like developing my physique and being a great boyfriend. Through my life journey, I want everyone to experience more out of their own lives. We only live for years, but the mark we leave on the world is permanent. I‚Äôm far from achieving that life approach, and. I don‚Äôt know what my future looks like. But the end result isn‚Äôt that important to me. I just want to be able to look back knowing. I took each action intentionally, made the tougher decision when it was right, and lived life in a way that. I can be proud of. That is what defines me, Yash. Moondhra. United. States. New.

Computer. Science: Virtual. Percussion. As a percussionist, I could never effectively practice mallet instruments when they were not in front of me. Mallet instruments have the same layout as a piano, but there were no online applications that allow you to use your keyboard as a mallet instrument in a user-friendly way. For my. IB. Computer. Science. Internal. Assessment, I used. Java to create a virtual xylophone, marimba, piano, and vibraphone which. I could play using the keys on my laptop. Creating it myself allowed me to add features that. I personally found useful, and organize the keys in a way that made sense in terms of the music. I was playing. Yash. Moondhra. Building the # crypto tax platform | ex-CTO @ Duffl (YC ) Marimba: Pirates of the. Caribbean. I came across a piano medley of. Pirates of the. Caribbean on. YouTube in tenth grade and was inspired to learn the entire song. I spent hours in front of my keyboard piano, which. I bought solely to learn the masterpiece. However, as someone who had never played piano before, I could not play the song even after my many hours of practice. In my senior year, I rediscovered this song with my friend, Joseph. Quatela, and we realized we could play the song using four mallets on two marimbas, which is like having eight fingers. We encountered many difficulties in learning this piece, because many of the rhythms and chords were extremely uncomfortable to play on a marimba. Every day after my meetings after school, I would spend at least two hours practicing. During my academic classes, if. I had already completed the project at hand, I would go practice marimba. After. I graduated, I came back to school roughly four times a week solely to play the instrument. And finally, during the summer, we accomplished our goal. Yash. Moondhra.

Marimba: Stubernic. Trio. During my high school's. Percussion. Summer. Camp, we spent roughly six hours per day learning many ensemble and solo pieces of music. In one of the lunch breaks, my music teacher showed us a song called "Stubernic", in which three musicians played on a single marimba. I was shocked by how the trio walked around each other while playing complex polyrhythms. Throughout the song, I had one constant thought: "I have to learn this." However, I was not close to ready, as. I had no experience playing with four mallets. In preparation for. Stubernic, I learned "Yellow. After. The. Rain". Stubernic is ranked in the highest difficulty category for high school marimba music by the. Florida. Bandmasters. Association. I performed it as a sophomore at my band's concert. In senior year, I revisited the masterpiece and performed it at the state-level, receiving the highest ratings possible. Yash. Moondhra.
