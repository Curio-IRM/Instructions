davisdt. Davis. Tran. SWE@Parafin | Prev. KP, Robinhood personal - Hi, I'm. Davis. I'm a first-generation (soon-to-be-grad) college student. I've been drumming since the grade - nowadays. I like to make drum tracks to jam to. I've been playing volleyball since grade - nowadays. I play recreationally with friends. Education and mentorship are both really important to me. I've been teaching all throughout college and plan on staying involved in some way beyond graduation. I'm very thankful to all of those who have played a huge role in my life in these regards; opportunities have come and been created, and my life has changed quite a few times in ways.
